            Soul of Christ, sanctify me. <br />
            Body of Christ, save me. <br />
            Blood of Christ, inebriate me. <br />
            Water from the side of Christ, wash me. <br />
            Passion of Christ, strengthen me. <br />
            O good Jesus, hear me. <br />
            Within Thy wounds hide me. <br />
            Suffer me not to be separated from Thee. <br />
            From the malignant enemy defend me. <br />
            In the hour of my death call me. <br />
            And bid me come unto Thee, <br />
            That I may praise Thee with Thy saints <br />
            and with Thy angels, <br />
            forever and ever. Amen.
