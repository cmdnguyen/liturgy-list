## Description

This is an application for VEYM Youth Leaders in the Liturgy Committee for their events.
The idea of the app started when my fellow Youth Leaders and I wanted to help train others to organize and plan for Catholic mass and adoration for camps.

The app has a general checklist for items used in mass and adoration to ensure that it's present and available.
It also has a description and generic photo of the item.
The app features a liturgy calendar and daily readings to display the mass celebration and the color the priests will wear.

Check out the deployed site here: https://liturgy-checklist.vercel.app/

## Usage

When you enter the page you will see the liturgy data, checklist and daily readings on the home page.
You can select between the mass checklist and adoration checklists to show the items needed.

There is swtiches for a scarf offering checklist group and Vietnamese translation for certain items.
Some items have icons that can be clicked to show the description and photo of the item.
Once the checklist is completed and the user clicks on the Finish button, it will send a modal and clears the checklist.

The liturgy data and daily readings are pulled up based on the today's date. You can also change the date in the Daily Readings page.
There are also links to the USCCB and ThanhLinh.net website to show the mass readings of the day.
